"<p>Classroom doors were decorated to celebrate Black History Month during the month of February. These doors include
	quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. to images celebrating black women, providing a visual into black excellence
	throughout history as students and teachers walk through the halls. This project was headed by Erin Mauch, an
	English teacher.</p>

				<div class="photocaption">The door to Room 103, where Tana Thompson works as an intervention specialist,
					displays images and information about civil rights activist Corretta Scott King, daughter of Dr.
					Martin Luther King, Jr. Another figure portrayed is Kelly Miller, a black intellectual. The door
					also displays Ernest Just, who was a black biologist known for discovering the role of cell surfaces
					in the development of an organism. Two other figures on the board are Martha Euphemia Lofton Haynes
					(the first black woman to earn a Ph.D in mathematics), and Emlen Tunnell, the first defensive back
					to be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. “The theme of our door was ‘Hidden Figures in Black
					History.’ Our class recently watched the movie ‘Hidden Figures’ while discussing the real-world
					application of math concepts we have studied in class,” Thompson said. “We thought decorating our
					door with uncommonly celebrated African Americans who have made great contributions to the math
					field, and the world as a whole, would be a great idea! Students selected people that they connected
					with or were inspired by after conducting research.”
